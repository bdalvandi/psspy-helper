# PSSPY Helper

## Overview

PSSPY Helper is a Python module designed to add Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capabilities to the `psspy` module of PSS/E (Power System Simulator for Engineering). This enhancement allows for more intuitive and structured interactions with the PSS/E API, facilitating the development of more maintainable and reusable code for power system simulations.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Simplifies interactions with `psspy` by introducing OOP principles.
- **Modular Structure**: Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Makes scripts easier to understand and follow.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Streamlines complex tasks in power system simulations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bdalvandi/psspy-helper.git
